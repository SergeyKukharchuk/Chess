1) Requirements

	Functional:
	1) The application must have shapes
	2) The application should place the pieces in their starting positions when starting a new game
	3) Each type of figure must follow certain (specific to it) instructions for movement, and "capture"
		and the possibility of "castling" of kings must also be implemented
	4) If the "pawn" reaches the opposite edge of the board, a choice must be made to "turn" the pawn into a piece on (rook\knight\bishop\queen)
	5) The game must end under the conditions of declaring a "checkmate" by one of the parties or if one of the partners decides to intentionally "pass" the game
	6) The game must end on the terms of a "draw": if the parties agree, if a "stalemate" occurs(one of the parties does not have the opportunity to move),
		if there is a lack of "material", or a triple repetition of the moves of one of the parties
		
	Non-functional:
	1) The application must have a menu with game option
	
2) Usage scenario\ use cases

	Interface
	- As a player, I can have a menu(new game\exit\finish game) to manage the app state
	- As a player, I can have the option to cancel a move to avoid inaccuracies.

	Application
	- As a player, I can be able to move the pieces to have the dynamics of the party
	- As a player, I can use the options "finish game" \ "start new game"
	- As a player, I can "knock down" the opponent's pieces to bring the end of the game closer
	- As a player, I can make a "castling"
	- As a player, I can declare "checkmate" to win the game
